# Project Name
This project is to create/build a model to predict the demand for shared bikes with respect to the available independent variables.
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- The objective of this project is to apply the learnings of linear regression procedure practically to address a business problem.
- This project is to provide the management a clear idea on what steps to be done inorder to increase the revenue or profit.
- The exact business problem which this model will address is to predict the demand for the shared bikes and how exactly this demand varies with different features.
- The dataset being used for this model is day.csv

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Technologies Used
- libraries - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodel

## Conclusions
- Demand of bikes mainly depends on the following featues - year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep, sun, Light_snowrain, Misty, summer and winter.
